 * These are extensions that are not part of the MIDI file standard, but are
 * built on top of the primitives provided there.  Files that use these events
 * will be compatible with other MIDI software, but the extension events will
 * be meaningless there.
 *
 * These extensions are all based on standard text events with particular
 * labels in them.
 *
 * The caret is the editing "cursor", where subsequent inserts should occur.
 * If there is no selection and there is an event immediately following the
 * caret at the same track and tick, then that following event should be the
 * target of editing operations.  There should be only one caret; extras after
 * the first are ignored.
 * 
 * Selections are the editing "highlight", for marking multiple events or time
 * ranges as the target of editing operations.  There can be multiple
 * discontiguous selections at once.
